#### Theme:                

Embracing Electric Vehicles

#### Context:               

Consumers are researching electric vehicles more than ever with their frequent appearances on roadways. It is estimated that by 2030, nearly one-third of all vehicles in America will be electric â€“ potentially opening the vehicle market to 320 million people worldwide. With peak fossil fuel consumption on the horizon, and electric vehicles becoming more affordable, the automotive industry is preparing to see a consumer shift in the near future.

#### Challenge:          

Create a fictional electric vehicle manufacturing company and design a website. The website should serve as a guide for information about the company and their electric vehicles offered. Present an overview of vehicles as if you were a consumer. Provide the type of vehicles your company creates, sells, and serves. Sections of the site may include photos, vehicle descriptions, specs, company history, contact, and news updates.

##### Key Takeways:

- Design an electric vehicle website (do some research, use sources like the Tesla website for inspiration)
- Create 2 - 3 vehicles in production and being sold
- Create vehicle designs, specs, 
- Explore and develop a company brand, provide some message or mission statement
